# California_Housing_price_prediction_Using_ML
The primary goal of this project was to build a machine learning model that could predict house prices in California based on factors such as location, population, income, and housing characteristics

Before training the machine learning models, I performed several data preprocessing steps to ensure high-quality data. These included:"
•	 Handling missing values by filling total_bedrooms with the median
•	 Scaling numerical features to bring them to a similar range
•	 Encoding categorical data like ocean_proximity using one-hot encoding
•	 Feature engineering by creating new features such as rooms_per_household and bedrooms_per_room, which improved model performance.
